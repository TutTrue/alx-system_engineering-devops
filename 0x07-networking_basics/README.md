## Learning Objectives

Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

### OSI Model
* What it is
* How many layers it has
* How it is organized
### What is a LAN
* Typical usage
* Typical geographical size
### What is a WAN
* Typical usage
* Typical geographical size
### What is the Internet
* What is an IP address
* What are the 2 types of IP address
* What is localhost
* What is a subnet
* Why IPv6 was created
### TCP/UDP
* What are the 2 mainly used data transfer protocols for IP (transfer level on the OSI schema)
* What is the main difference between TCP and UDP
* What is a port
* Memorize SSH, HTTP and HTTPS port numbers
* What tool/protocol is often used to check if a * device is connected to a network## Tasks
